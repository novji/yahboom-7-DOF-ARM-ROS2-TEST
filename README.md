# JetCobot 7-DOF ROS2 Package 

ROS2 package for controlling the **Yahboom JetCobot 7 DOF collaborative robotic arm**  
with Jetson Nano / Jetson Orin and ROS2 (tested with Humble / Foxy style layout).

> **Note:** This repo provides a *clean structure and example nodes*.  
> You’ll still need to plug in Yahboom's official SDK / drivers for real hardware comms.
